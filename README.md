# Placement Prediction

## Overview

The Placement Prediction project is a machine learning application based on logistic regression. It predicts the likelihood of placement for students based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical placement information.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** The core of the project is a logistic regression model trained on a dataset with relevant features such as academic performance, skills, and extracurricular activities.

- **Streamlit UI:** The user interface is developed using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to interact with the placement prediction model.

## Getting Started
